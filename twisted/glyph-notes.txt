Bulleted lists suck
Don't say it's simple
Too many examples, give a thoroughly-explained toy example

The modules:
* High-level functions
    - Lambda lambda lambda
* Why asynchronous?
    - Define synchronous and asynchronous
    - Multiplexing IO
    - Introduce a simple reactor based on select()
* Why callbacks?
    - Asynchronous interaction to synchronous interaction
    - Delocalized execution (the parser example)
* Why deferred?
    - Ad hoc callback params versus Deferred objects
