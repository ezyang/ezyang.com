<h1>Guide to twisted.internet.defer</h1>

<p>This document addresses Twisted's
implementation of Deferred objects in
<code class="API">twisted.internet.defer.Deferred</code>.  It
assumes familiarity with the basics of event loops and
asynchronous programming.</p>

<h2>Deferreds standardize callbacks</h2>

<p>Callbacks are the lingua franca of asynchronous programming:
any time you need to process the result of a non-blocking operation,
you give that operation a callback for it to call when it has
finished processing and has a result for you.</p>

<p>If you were implementing an asynchronous function from scratch,
you might be tempted to define it like this:</p>

<pre class="python">
def nonblocking_call(input, on_success, on_error):
    pass
</pre>

<p>The person using this code, then, would pass the functions he
wanted called to this function at call time, like this:</p>

<pre class="python">
def success_handler(result):
    print "Success: %s" % result
def error_handler(error):
    print "Failure: %s" % str(error)
nonblocking_call("input", success_handler, error_handler)
</pre>

<p>This works quite well for many simple cases, where you only
need one success handler and one error handler, and the nonblocking
call is a relatively one off function.</p>

<p>But what if you are Twisted and you have many nonblocking functions:
do you force every one of these functions to have a <code>on_success</code>
and <code>on_error</code>
parameter?  What if you want to perform a calculation on the result
of the <code>success_handler</code>: do you write all of the code into a bigger
<code>success_handler</code> and increase the indentation?</p>

<p>Twisted's elegant solution to this problem is Deferreds.  Since
the nonblocking call doesn't have a meaningful return value anyway (remember,
it's asynchronous; it can return before it has a result), we return
a Deferred which you can attach callbacks to.</p>

<pre class="python">
d = nonblocking_call("input")
d.addCallback(success_handler)
d.addErrback(error_handler)
</pre>

<p>The Deferred object doesn't do anything that you couldn't have done
with the two callback parameters.  This point is worth repeating: Deferred
is an abstraction over callback parameters: it does nothing magical
and is not, itself, asynchronous.  It is a merely a standard:
if a function returns a Deferred,
you <em>know</em> that you are dealing with an asynchronous function,
and you know exactly what its API for adding callbacks is.</p>

<h2>Deferred</h2>

<h3>Callbacks</h3>

<p>At its very simplest, the Deferred has a single callback attached to it, which
gets invoked with the result as an argument when it becomes available:</p>

<table class="compare">
    <tr>
        <th>Synchronous</th>
        <th>Asynchronous</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><pre class="python">
value = synchronous_operation()
process(value)
        </pre></td>
        <td><pre class="python">
d = asynchronous_operation()
d.addCallback(process)
        </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h3>Errbacks</h3>

<p>Error handling is an ever present concern in synchronous code.  Deferred
implements a system of <strong>errbacks</strong> in order to simulate Python
try/except blocks.  Just like in synchronous code, you <em>always</em> should
register an errback in order to deal with an error gracefully.</p>

<table class="compare">
    <tr>
        <th>Synchronous</th>
        <th>Asynchronous</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><pre class="python">
try:
    synchronous_operation()
except UserError as e:
    handle_error(e)
        </pre></td>
        <td><pre class="python">
def handle_twisted_error(failure):
    e = failure.trap(UserError)
    handle_error(e)
d = asynchronous_operation()
d.addErrback(handle_twisted_error)
        </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>There are plenty of things going on here:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Instead of being passed an exception object, which is roughly
    analogous to the result in the no error case, you are passed a
    <code>twisted.python.failure.Failure</code> object.  This is roughly
    a wrapper around the standard <code>Exception</code> with a few
    crucial enhancements to make it useful in an asynchronous context.</li>

    <li>Consequently, we pull out the real exception by using
    <code>failure.trap(UserError)</code>.  This is the userland implementation
    of <code>except</code>; if the exception is not trapped, it gets
    re-thrown and our errback is bypassed.  <!-- You wouldn't actually write Python
    code that looked like this, but this is a more faithful rendition of
    what is happening:
    <pre class="python">
try:
    synchronous_operation()
except:
    e = sys.exc_info()[1] # get the exception
    # trap the exception
    if not isinstance(e, UserError):
        raise e
    handle_error(e)
    </pre> --></li>

    <li>You can trap multiple types of exceptions by simply calling trap
    with multiple arguments, e.g. <code>failure.trap(UserError, OtherUserError)</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Omitting the trap declaration is equivalent to a catch-all
except block:</p>

<table class="compare">
    <tr>
        <th>Synchronous</th>
        <th>Asynchronous</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><pre class="python">
try:
    synchronous_operation()
except:
    handle_error()
    raise
        </pre></td>
        <td><pre class="python">
def handle_twisted_error(failure):
    handle_error()
    return failure
d = asynchronous_operation()
d.addErrback(handle_twisted_error)
        </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>Notice that in order to re-raise the exception, we simply
return it from our errback handler.  Deferred will notice that it
is the type of a failure object, and act accordingly.
You can <em>also</em> throw an exception and Deferred will
handle it properly:</p>

<pre class="python">
def handle_twisted_error(failure):
    status = handle_error(failure.value)
    if not status:
        raise UserError
d = asynchronous_operation()
d.addErrback(handle_twisted_error)
</pre>

<p>If you would like to re-raise the original error, it is preferred to use
<code>failure.raiseException()</code>, which preserves traceback information
if available.</p>

<p>Failure has another convenience function, <code>check()</code>, which
makes it easier to simulate multiple <code>except</code> blocks:</p>

<table class="compare">
    <tr>
        <th>Synchronous</th>
        <th>Asynchronous</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><pre class="python">
try:
    synchronous_operation()
except UserError:
    handle_error()
except AnotherUserError:
    handler_another_error()
        </pre></td>
        <td><pre class="python">
def handle_twisted_error(failure):
    if failure.check(UserError):
        handle_error()
    elif failure.check(AnotherUserError):
        handle_another_error()
    else:
        failure.raiseException()
d = asynchronous_operation()
d.addErrback(handle_twisted_error)
        </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h3>Callbacks and errbacks</h3>

<p>In most cases, you'll want to perform some processing on the deferred
result <em>as well</em> as have error handling.  As you may have guessed,
this simply means you should define both a callback and an errback.</p>

<table class="compare">
    <tr>
        <th>Synchronous</th>
        <th>Asynchronous</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><pre class="python">
try:
    value = synchronous_operation()
    process(value)
except UserError as e:
    handle_error(e)
        </pre></td>
        <td><pre class="python">
def handle_twisted_error(failure):
    e = failure.trap(UserError)
    handle_error(e)
d = asynchronous_operation()
d.addCallback(process)
d.addErrback(handle_twisted_error)
        </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>Notice that in the synchronous version, <code>process</code>
is <em>inside</em> the try..except block.  This translates over
to the asynchronous code: if
<code>process</code> throws an exception, <code>handle_twisted_error</code>
will get a <code>Failure</code> object corresponding to that
exception.  The errback could handle <em>either</em> an error
from the asynchronous operation or from our callback.
Why does this happen?  This is because
Deferreds chain callbacks.</p>

<h3>Chaining callbacks</h3>

<p>A common pattern in programs is the notion of one function
returning an intermediate result, which gets passed to another
function to calculate a further result, and so forth.  Such a
chain of data processing entities is called a <em>pipeline</em>,
and Deferreds are ideally suited for modeling them.</p>

<table class="compare">
    <tr>
        <th>Synchronous</th>
        <th>Asynchronous</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><pre class="python">
value = synchronous_operation()
value2 = process(value)
another_process(value2) # value2, not value!
        </pre></td>
        <td><pre class="python">
d = asynchronous_operation()
d.addCallback(process)
d.addCallback(another_process)
        </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>This behavior makes the name <code>addCallback</code>
slightly misleading, since each of these
callbacks will get a different result.  If you would like to multiplex
(have multiple callbacks handle the same result), you should code
this directly into your callback:</p>

<table class="compare">
    <tr>
        <th>Synchronous</th>
        <th>Asynchronous</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><pre class="python">
value = synchronous_operation()
process(value)
another_process(value)
        </pre></td>
        <td><pre class="python">
def multi_process(value):
    process(value)
    return another_process(value)
d = asynchronous_operation()
d.addCallback(multi_process)
        </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>Errbacks work similarly, but instead of pipelining values
through multiple functions, they create nested try..except
blocks:</p>

<table class="compare">
    <tr>
        <th>Synchronous</th>
        <th>Asynchronous</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><pre class="python">
try:
    try:
        synchronous_operation()
    except UserError as e:
        handle_error(e)
except AnotherUserError as e:
    handle_another_error(e)
        </pre></td>
        <td><pre class="python">
def handle_twisted_error(failure):
    e = failure.trap(UserError)
    handle_error(e)
def handle_twisted_another_error(failure):
    e = failure.trap(AnotherUserError)
    handle_another_error(e)
d = asynchronous_operation()
d.addErrback(handle_twisted_error)
d.addErrback(handle_twisted_another_error)
        </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>Now, we can do tricky things with chaining callbacks and errbacks.
The following code makes it possible for the errback function to gracefully
provide the result of the computation, even though it failed (perhaps
from a cache).</p>

<table class="compare">
    <tr>
        <th>Synchronous</th>
        <th>Asynchronous</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><pre class="python">
try:
    value = synchronous_operation()
except UserError as e:
    value = handle_error(e)
process(value)
        </pre></td>
        <td><pre class="python">
def handle_twisted_error(failure):
    e = failure.trap(UserError)
    return handle_error(e)
d = asynchronous_operation()
d.addErrback(handle_twisted_error)
d.addCallback(process)
        </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>This code introduces a new function: <code>addCallbacks</code>, which
adds both a callback and an errback.  Unlike adding them individually, if
the callback errors, the errback will not receive the error, and if the
errback returns a valid result, the callback will not receive it.  They
are completely isolated from each other.</p>

<table class="compare">
    <tr>
        <th>Synchronous</th>
        <th>Asynchronous</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><pre class="python">
try:
    value = synchronous_operation()
except UserError as e:
    handle_error(e)
else:
    process(value)
        </pre></td>
        <td><pre class="python">
def handle_twisted_error(failure):
    e = failure.trap(UserError)
    handle_error(e)
d = asynchronous_operation()
d.addCallbacks(process, handle_twisted_error)
        </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>Let's stick our hand inside the black box and see what actually is
happening.  The order in which we add callbacks and errbacks is obviously
influencing the end behavior.  Here's why:</p>

<p>Internally, Deferred stores callbacks and errbacks in a list of
callback/errback tuples.  When you call <code>addCallback</code>
or <code>addErrback</code>, you are not adding a callback/errback
to separate stacks; instead, Deferred wraps your callback into a
tuple (substituting a "pass through" function for the missing
callback/errback) and sticks this on the callback/errback tuple list.
</p>

<p>The result from the asynchronous function will either
be a <code>Failure</code> object, or some
other Python value.  If it is the former, Deferred will call
your errback function in the tuple with the result; the latter will result
in a call to the callback function in the tuple.  The function
call itself can result in two end results, another failure (either
by returning a Failure object or by raising an Exception) or
a regular Python value.  Deferred will then move to the next
tuple and repeat until there are no more tuples left.</p>

<p>Take the following code as an example:</p>

<pre class="python">
d = asynchronous_operation()
d.addCallback(callback1) # tuple 1
d.addCallback(callback2) # tuple 2
d.addErrback(errback3) # tuple 3
d.addCallbacks(callback4, errback4) # tuple 4
</pre>

<p>Consider two possible scenarios.  First, success:</p>

<ol>
    <li>The asynchronous operation succeeds with a result of <code>"Foo"</code>.</li>
    <li>No failure. We give <code>"Foo"</code> to the callback of tuple 1,
    <code>callback1</code>.  It returns <code>("Foo", 123)</code>.</li>
    <li>No failure. We give <code>("Foo", 123)</code> to the callback of tuple 2,
    <code>callback2</code>.  It returns <code>"Foo123"</code>.</li>
    <li>No failure. We give <code>"Foo123"</code> to the callback of tuple 3,
    which happens to be a pass through function.  It returns
    <code>"Foo123"</code>.</li>
    <li>No failure. We give <code>"Foo123"</code>
    to the callback of tuple 4, <code>callback4</code>.  It does something, but
    the return value is not given to anyone.  <!-- maybe mention what happens
    to failures at the end of chains? --></li>
</ol>

<p>What about failure?</p>

<ol>
    <li>The asynchronous operation fails, and a Failure object is constructed.</li>
    <li>Failure. We give the failure object to the errback of tuple 1, which
    happens to be pass through function.  It returns the failure object.</li>
    <li>Failure. We give the failure object to the errback of tuple 2, which is
    also a pass through function.  It returns the failure object.</li>
    <li>Failure. We give the failure object to the errback of tuple 3,
    <code>errback3</code>.  It acknowledges and logs the error.  It doesn't
    return anything.</li>
    <li>No failure (remember, <code>None</code> is a
    valid result value!) We give <code>None</code> to the callback of tuple 4,
    <code>callback4</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Think of your callback/errback chains as parallel
pipes of execution, which could transfer to one another at any point.  As
a parting word, here is a use of one convenience function, <code>addBoth</code>.</p>

<table class="compare">
    <tr>
        <th>Synchronous</th>
        <th>Asynchronous</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><pre class="python">
try:
    synchronous_operation()
finally:
    cleanup()
        </pre></td>
        <td><pre class="python">
d = asynchronous_operation()
d.addBoth(lambda x: cleanup())
        </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>The lambda is simply a convenient way to avoid passing <code>x</code> to
<code>clean()</code> (lest Python raise a <code>TypeError</code>).</p>

<h3>Fluent interface</h3>

<p>Deferred implements a fluent interface for adding callbacks, where the
return value of <code>addCallback</code>, <code>addErrback</code> or any
other similar method is the object itself (<code>return self</code>).  This means you can
write this:</p>

<pre class="python">
d = asynchronous_operation()
d.addCallback(f1).addCallback(f2).addCallback(f3)
</pre>

<p>which is equivalent to:</p>

<pre class="python">
d = asynchronous_operation()
d.addCallback(f1)
d.addCallback(f2)
d.addCallback(f3)
</pre>

<p>Use of this style is a matter of taste and consistency.</p>

<h2>Chaining Deferreds</h2>

<p>All of the examples, to this point, have been focused around
a single asynchronous operation, and the synchronous post-processing of that
operation.  However, in the real world, you will often need to
run multiple asynchronous operations, one after the other.  For
example, if you
make an HTTP request, and find out that the request is a redirect,
you need to make another (asynchronous) HTTP request.</p>

<p>Our code, then, is fatally hobbled if we can't easily chain
deferreds together. With the framework we setup previously,
we could implement something along the lines of having the
callback call the next asynchronous function, and then setup
the callbacks on the deferreds <em>that</em> function returned.</p>

<table class="compare">
    <tr>
        <th>Synchronous</th>
        <th>Asynchronous</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><pre class="python">
value  = synchronous_operation_a()
value2 = synchronous_operation_b(value)
process(value2)
        </pre></td>
        <td><pre class="python">
def chain(result):
    d = asynchronous_operation_b(result)
    d.addCallback(process)
d = asynchronous_operation_a()
d.addCallback(chain)
        </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>But we just spent the first section explaining our wonderful system
of multiple callbacks and errbacks and, as you might notice, there isn't
actually a way to get <code>chain</code> to return the value of process in this
example without making it synchronous.</p>

<p>To make this work, Twisted does something special:  it lets callbacks
return Deferred, and treats it to mean, "this callback doesn't have the
answer yet, but when this Deferred fires it will!"</p>

<table class="compare">
    <tr>
        <th>Synchronous</th>
        <th>Asynchronous</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><pre class="python">
value  = synchronous_operation_a()
value2 = synchronous_operation_b(value)
process(value2)
        </pre></td>
        <td><pre class="python">
d = asynchronous_operation_a()
d.addCallback(asynchronous_operation_b)
d.addCallback(process)
        </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>Written a little more explicitly (in case you're still squeamish
about higher order functions), the asynchronous code is equivalent to this:</p>

<pre class="python">
def chain(result):
    return asynchronous_operation_b(result)
d = asynchronous_operation_a()
d.addCallback(chain)
d.addCallback(process)
</pre>

<p>The mantra is thus:  <em>Callbacks and errbacks can return deferreds</em>.</p>

<p>Now, for some examples.</p>

<h3>Dependencies</h3>

<p>Well written, maintainable callbacks maintain "contracts" with respect to
their behavior.  Any given callback should have a well-defined value it takes
and a well-defined value that it returns.  This is good sense that applies
not only to callbacks but also to functions.</p>

<p>We've now added a slight twist to this, in that any callback can
return the value that it is contractually obligated to supply, or it
can <em>promise</em> to return to the value in the form of a Deferred. (Imagine
if you could get away doing this in real life!)  And, in the process of fulfilling
that promise, you discover you need to do another asynchronous request.  Something
has just happened: you're resolving a dependency chain.</p>

<p>[ here goes an example with actual running Twisted code in three steps.
Pictures of how the "callback" chain looks like as we discover more and
more dependencies should be supplied ]</p>

<h3>Looping</h3>

<p>A common form of dependency is needing to perform the asynchronous
operation all over again.  The canonical example of this an HTTP
redirect: when the callback for a deferred from a page request is
returned, it could be the result, or it could be an empty body
with the <code>Location</code> HTTP header set, in which case
you simply perform the operation over again.</p>

<p>[ here is the HTTP redirect example.  It also should have pictures. ]</p>

<h3>Lambdas</h3>

<p>We now take this opportunity to remind you that chaining deferreds
often results in the creation of lots of little functions to shuffle
the result of one operation to the next asynchronous function.  Sometimes
you can be clever and pass the asynchronous function itself as a callback,
but this only works if the next asynchronous function takes a single
parameter, and that parameter is the result of the previous computation.</p>

<p>In simple cases, you may want to use a lambda to move a parameter
around, or partially apply a function.  Suppose we have an asynchronous
function <code>send_message(value, type)</code>, and we know that
in our code type should equal <code>2</code>, then:</p>

<table class="compare">
    <tr>
        <th>Without lambdas</th>
        <th>With lambdas</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><pre class="python">
def send_message_callback(result):
    return send_message(result, 2)
d = asynchronous_operation()
d.addCallback(send_message_callback)
        </pre></td>
        <td><pre class="python">
d = asynchronous_operation()
d.addCallback(lambda x: send_message(x, 2))
        </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<!--<p>Callbacks and errbacks, combined together, form a language of flow
control for deferreds, giving us asynchronous analogs of try
catch blocks.  It is not a stretch, then, that you might need
asynchronous analogs of other classic flow control mechanisms:
if statements, for loops, etc.</p>

<p>Let us think about this more carefully, then: when would
you need some special support for conditional flow or looping
flow?  If you have actual Python values (not deferreds) of
the values that you need to test for, you can just use the usual
Python structures and be done with it.  Even if the test value
is a deferred object, you can bundle up your code and place it
into a callback.</p>

<table class="compare">
    <tr>
        <th>Synchronous</th>
        <th>Asynchronous</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><pre class="python">
if synchronous_operation():
    do_something()
else:
    do_something_else()
        </pre></td>
        <td><pre class="python">
def success_handler(result):
    if result:
        do_something()
    else:
        do_something_else()
d = asynchronous_operation()
d.addCallback(success_handler)
        </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>What's a little more difficult is if the code in the
conditional branches are asynchronous.</p>-->

<h2>Composing Deferreds</h2>

<!--<p>Up until now, we've assumed the existence of <code>asynchronous_operation()</code>,
a black box asynchronous function that returns a Deferred for us to add callbacks to,
which will get called when it finishes its black box magic.</p>

<p>As it turns out, when you start making more and more deferreds, and the
interactions between them increase in complexity, you will find yourself in
the situation where you'd like a deferred that gets triggered when some other
number of deferreds are triggered.  Perhaps you're running a batch image download
script, and you would like to zip up all the files when they're finished downloading;
you can't attach the zip callback to any single one of the download deferreds, since
you want all of them to finish!  If you were to imagine execution flow as a graph
(ignoring errbacks for a moment), all of the previous cases we described involved
a single line of flow.  Now, when we execute things in <em>parallel</em>, this
single line splits into many lines, and merge back together.</p>-->

<p>Chaining deferred dealt with sequential computation: each successive
asynchronous operation required the result of the previous computation
in order to run.  But we could have done this very easily synchronously:
asynchronous execution shines when we want to perform computations in
<em>parallel</em>.  But parallelizing computations results in some
questions: when is a parallel computation complete?  How do I treat
these parallel computations as a single unit?</p>

<p>The answer is <em>composition</em>, that is, we can combine deferreds
together into a single deferred.  As it turns out, Twisted has some
built-in facilities for doing this.</p>

<h3>The implementation of a DeferredList</h3>

<p>Consider a Deferred that
would only fire after some other number of Deferreds fired.</p>

<pre class="python">
class FireWhenAllFinish(Deferred):
    def __init__(self, deferreds):
        self.deferreds = deferreds
</pre>

<p>We start off with a logical constructor for our class: a simple
list of the Deferred objects we want to finish before this Deferred
fires.  Recall that we need to setup callbacks in each Deferred in
<code>deferreds</code> to tell us when they've finished.  Thus:</p>

<pre class="python">
class FireWhenAllFinish(Deferred):
    def __init__(self, deferreds):
        self.deferreds = deferreds
        for d in self.deferreds:
            self.addCallbacks(self._cbDeferred, self._ebDeferred)
            self.addErrback(self._ebDeferred)
    def _cbDeferred(self, result):
        raise NotImplemented
    def _ebDeferred(self, failure):
        raise NotImplemented
</pre>

<p>Now, for the definition of <code>_cbDeferred</code>, after a little
thought, and the knowledge that <code>callback()</code> and
<code>errback()</code> are the
methods you can use to <em>fire</em> a deferred (it's what
<code>asynchronous_operation()</code> would have called behind
the veil), a relatively simple implementation comes to mind:</p>

<pre class="python">
class FireWhenAllFinish(Deferred):
    def __init__(self, deferreds):
        self.deferreds = deferreds
        self.finishedCount = 0
        if not self.deferreds:
            self.callback()
        for d in self.deferreds:
            self.addCallbacks(self._cbDeferred, self._ebDeferred)
    def _cbDeferred(self, result):
        self.finishedCount += 1
        if self.finishedCount == len(self.deferreds):
            self.callback()
    def _ebDeferred(self, failure):
        if not self.called: # this property is True if callback()/errback() has already been called
            self.failed = True
            self.errback()
</pre>

<p>There are two gotchas: the first is that if there were no
deferreds passed into this deferred, we should automatically fire
our callback; after all, we're not waiting on anything thing.
The second is that <code>callback()</code> and <code>errback()</code>
must only be called (between the two of them) once, so we manually
guard for this by checking if <code>self.called</code> is <code>False</code>
before making the errback call (why such a check is unnecessary for
callback call is left as an exercise for the reader.)</p>

<!--<p>There is one thing that is notably missing from our current
implementation: results.</p> -->
