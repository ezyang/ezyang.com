    In distributed applications, the transmission of non-contiguous data
    structures is greatly slowed down by the need to serialize them into
    a buffer before sending.  We describe Compact Normal Forms, an API that
    allows programmers to explicitly place immutable heap objects into regions,
    which can both be accessed like ordinary data as well as efficiently
    transmitted over the network.  The process of placing objects into
    compact regions (essentially a copy) is faster than any serializer
    and can be amortized over a series of functional updates to the data
    structure in question.  We implement this scheme in the Glasgow Haskell Compiler and show
    that even with the space expansion attendant with memory-oriented
    data structure representations, we achieve between ×2 and
    ×4 speedups on fast local networks with sufficiently large
    data structures.

<div class="cb">
    <p>The most recent source distributions are available at
    <a href="https://github.com/gcampax/ghc/releases">Giovanni Campagna's</a> GitHub
    repository.</p>
    <p>The base GHC distribution only exposes an interfaces for getting
    raw pointers to compact regions.  A sample library for sending and receiving compacts over simple
    sockets is on Hackage under the name <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/compact-socket">compact-socket</a>; you can install it with <code>cabal install compact-socket --with-ghc=/path/to/compact/ghc</code></p>
</div>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<div class="cb">
    <p>Our distribution of GHC comes with a new core library <code>compact</code>
    which contains the user-facing API for manipulating compact regions.  You
    can view the <a href="compact/Data-Compact.html">API documentation</a>.  The
    API documentation differs slightly from the paper in a few ways:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Most functions are prefixed by <code>compact</code>,</li>
        <li>There are variants of functions which preserve sharing and
        which don't prefer sharing (most of the benchmarks in the paper
        were done with the no-sharing variant, which is a bit faster),</li>
        <li>We use the <code>NFData</code> type class rather than a new
            <code>Serializable</code> type class, and error at runtime
        if you attempt to serialize a data structure which is not
        serializable, and</li>
        <li>You need to specify some default block size for compact
        regions.  The larger the block size, the more continuity you
        have, but also the more space that is wasted.</li>
