    In distributed applications, the transmission of non-contiguous data
    structures is greatly slowed down by the need to serialize them into
    a buffer before sending.  We describe Compact Normal Forms, an API that
    allows programmers to explicitly place immutable heap objects into regions,
    which can both be accessed like ordinary data as well as efficiently
    transmitted over the network.  The process of placing objects into
    compact regions (essentially a copy) is faster than any serializer
    and can be amortized over a series of functional updates to the data
    structure in question.  We implement this scheme in the Glasgow Haskell Compiler and show
    that even with the space expansion attendant with memory-oriented
    data structure representations, we achieve between ×2 and
    ×4 speedups on fast local networks with sufficiently large
    data structures.

<!--<h2>Code</h2>
<div class="cb">
    <p>The base GHC distribution only exposes an interfaces for getting
    raw pointers to compact regions.  A sample library for sending and receiving compacts over simple
    sockets is on Hackage under the name <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/compact-socket">compact-socket</a>; you can install it with <code>cabal install compact-socket --with-ghc=/path/to/compact/ghc</code></p>
</div>-->
<h2>Usage</h2>
<div class="cb">
    <p>Thanks to Simon Marlow, compact normal forms will be shipping
    with GHC 8.2; see the <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/master/libraries/html/compact/index.html">Haddock</a> for the actual API we provide.
    The API documentation differs slightly from the paper in a few ways:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Most functions are prefixed by <code>compact</code>,</li>
        <li>There are variants of functions which preserve sharing and
        which don't prefer sharing (most of the benchmarks in the paper
        were done with the no-sharing variant, which is a bit faster),</li>
        <li>We use the <code>NFData</code> type class rather than a new
            <code>Serializable</code> type class, and error at runtime
        if you attempt to serialize a data structure which is not
        serializable, and</li>
        <li>You can specify a default block size for compact
        regions.  The larger the block size, the more continuity you
        have, but also the more space that is wasted.</li>
    </ol>

<h2>Errata</h2>
<div class="cb">
    <p>At ICFP, we were informed of two relevant pieces of work which had
    escaped our notice prior to the camera-ready.  We'd like to acknowledge
    this work:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Jost Berthold. <strong><a href="http://www.diku.dk/~berthold/papers/mainIFL10-withCopyright.pdf">Orthogonal Serialisation for Haskell</a></strong>.  In <em>Proceedings of the 22nd Symposium on Implementation and Application of Functional Languages</em>. 2011.  This paper describes
        a method for serializing by directly using the information tables which are
        available by the runtime system for garbage collection or other mechanisms.
        This method does require serialization, but consequently does not require
        virtual address tricks.  Their API supports serializing more types of objects than
        we deal with in our paper; we rely on data being in normal form for our safety
        guarantees.</li>
        <li>Andrew Appel. <strong><a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.35.4846">A Runtime System</a></strong>. 1990.  In Section 17, "Structured writes and reads", Appel
        describes a nice mechanism for piggy-backing off of garbage collection in order
        to perform a copy to a "region" (in their case, a file).  However, in order to
        be able to write forwarding pointers, they must stop-the-world; our system can
        initialize multiple compact regions concurrently without inducing a GC.</li>
