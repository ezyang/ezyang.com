We describe the semantics and implementation of a resource limits
system for Haskell, allowing programmers to create resource
containers which enforce bounded resident memory usage.  Our system
is distinguished by a clear allocator-pays semantics drawn from
previous experience with profiling in Haskell and an implementation
strategy which uses a block-structured heap to organize containers,
allowing us to enforce limits with high accuracy.  To deal with the
problem of deallocating data in a garbage collected heap, we propose
a novel taint-based mechanism that unifies the existing practices of
revocable pointers and killing threads in order to reclaim memory.
Our system is implemented in GHC, a production-strength compiler for Haskell.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<div class="cb">
    <p>We have a <a href="papers/ezyang13-rlimits.pdf">previous version
    of the paper</a> (<a href="papers/ezyang13-rlimits.bib">BibTeX</a>), which was rejected from ICFP'13, which described
    an old iteration of the system, which directly utilized GHC's cost-center profiling in
    order to implement resource limits.  It was a very cute implementation, but it was
    very costly, since it required all code to be compiled with profiling.  We've since
    reimplemented the system to take advantage of GHC's block-structured heap, for a
    sizeable speed increase.</p>

<h2>Source code</h2>
<div class="cb">
    <p>You can probably find the latest version of the code on <a
    href="https://github.com/ezyang/ghc">GitHub</a> (I say "probably" because
    I often use this repository as a dumping ground for any changes I
    need to move around).  A more proper release will be coming soon.
    Nota bene: I keep my fork up-to-date with upstream by repeatedly
    rebasing.</p>
