We describe the semantics and implementation of a resource limits
system for Haskell, allowing programmers to create resource
containers which enforce bounded resident memory usage.  Our system
is distinguished by a clear allocator-pays semantics drawn from
previous experience with profiling in Haskell and an implementation
strategy which uses a block-structured heap to organize containers,
allowing us to enforce limits with high accuracy.  To deal with the
problem of deallocating data in a garbage collected heap, we propose
a novel taint-based mechanism that unifies the existing practices of
revocable pointers and killing threads in order to reclaim memory.
Our system is implemented in GHC, a production-strength compiler for Haskell.</p>

    <p>We are participating in the PLDI'14 artifact evaluation process,
    so if you are interested in trying out our system with minimal
    fuss, check out our <a href="https://github.com/ezyang/pldi14-rlimits-aec">artifact
        description page</a> for a ready-made VM image, a tutorial and evaluation code
    from the paper.
    </p>
    <p>To get and compile the code yourself, check the <code>ghc-rlimits-20130210</code>
    tag of <a href="https://github.com/ezyang/ghc/tree/ghc-rlimits-20130210">ghc</a>
    and <a href="https://github.com/ezyang/packages-integer-gmp/commit/26d4064328ba8e62aa4d218c2367ceb22c2169a9">this patch to integer-gmp</a> (set your other branches to <code>ghc-7.8</code>).  The compilation process is the same
    as for <a href="https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Building">normal GHC</a>, with the caveat that it will not work
    for 32-bit platforms.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<div class="cb">

    <p><strong>Why not use an OS mechanism like rlimits?</strong></p><p>
    Mechanisms like rlimits work well in many cases, but they impose conceptual
    and runtime overhead.  The conceptual overhead comes from needing to restructure
    an application into multiple processes to apply per-process limits: a mechanism
    that is built into a language is much easier to use.  The runtime overhead
    comes from the overhead of processes and inter-process communication; in
    a single-runtime system like ours there is no overhead beyond cache effects.

    <p><strong>I don't use Haskell.  Why should I care?</strong></p>
    <p>
    It's easy to conclude that this paper is Haskell-specific, what with
    “Haskell” being in the title and all.  However, it is
    worth talking more carefully about what specific features of Haskell
    our system relies on. In order of increasing specificity to Haskell, we rely on: (1) the
    ability to create multiple regions in the heap cheaply (<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/parallel-gc/">a
        block-structured heap</a>), (2) the ability to safely terminate threads
    (<a href="http://community.haskell.org/~simonmar/papers/async.pdf">asynchronous exceptions</a>), and (3) the ability to statically isolate
    code (restricted monads/<a href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/users_guide/safe-haskell.html">Safe Haskell</a>).
    </p>
    <p>The first condition is not at all specific to Haskell, and is
    really all you need to get half of our resource limits system (tracking
    of consumed memory).  Block-structured heaps are well worth considering
    the next time you need to write a memory system: the design is very flexible, and
    in retrospect has been considered one of the "best decisions"
    to have been made for Haskell's storage manager.</p>
    <p>The second condition is not specific to Haskell per se, but Haskell's
    purity and culture of using <code>bracket</code> makes it far more
    reasonable to assume that arbitrary code will be able to recover
    from being killed by an asynchronous exception.  This may not be true in
    languages like Java, where resource limits systems like <a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/osdi02/tech/full_papers/hawblitzel/hawblitzel_html/index.html">Luna</a>
    specifically avoid killing threads.  Still, we think most would
    argue that asynchronous exceptions (which work well) are a desirable feature
    to have in any language.</p>
    <p>The final condition is rather Haskell specific.  While in principle this
    API could be implemented in any language, the inability to enforce
    its usage in the type system could lead to difficult to diagnose
    leaks of references.  Monads in Haskell help us a lot here, and the ability
    to run untrusted code using Safe Haskell provides a compelling use-case
    for resource limits. We freely admit that we are taking advantages of
    Haskell's circumstances.</p>
    <p>It's worth noting that our implementation does not rely on laziness:
    while handling it is a technical result, without it the implementation can be
    simplified in the obvious way.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<div class="cb">
    <p>We have a <a href="papers/ezyang13-rlimits.pdf">previous version
    of the paper entitled "Resource Limits for Haskell"</a> (<a href="papers/ezyang13-rlimits.bib">BibTeX</a>), which was rejected from ICFP'13, which described
    an old iteration of the system, which directly utilized GHC's cost-center profiling in
    order to implement resource limits.  It was a very cute implementation, but it was
    very costly, since it required all code to be compiled with profiling.  We've since
    reimplemented the system to take advantage of GHC's block-structured heap, for a
    sizeable speed increase.</p>
