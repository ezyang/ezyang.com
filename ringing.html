    <p>We are the Bay Area Guild of Change Ringers, founded in 2013.  There are
        no towers in the area, but we ring handbells <strong>Thursday nights</strong>
        from <strong>10pm-12pm</strong> at the <strong>Gates Computer Science Building</strong>
        on Stanford campus.  We ring on a set of eight bells graciously loaned to us
        by Laura Dickerson.  The regulars are Edward, Risha, Jenna and Leland.</p>

        <p>If you are planning a visit, please do let us know by email!
        (In particular, you will need one of our phone numbers so we can
        let you into the building.) We are not too advanced (we are
        currently working on getting good enough to ring a quarter of
        Plain Bob Minor), but we would love to have your presence,
        beginner or advanced.</p>
