    <p>We are the Bay Area Guild of Change Ringers, founded in 2013.  There are
        no towers in the area, but we ring handbells <strong>Thursday nights</strong>
        from <strong>10pm-midnight</strong> at the <strong>Gates Computer Science Building</strong>
        on Stanford campus.  We ring on a set of eight bells graciously loaned to us
        by Laura Dickerson.  The regulars are Edward, Risha and Jenna.  Former regulars
        include Leland.</p>

        <p>If you are planning a visit, please do let us know <a href="mailto:change-ringers@lists.stanford.edu">by email</a>!
        (In particular, you will need one of our phone numbers so we can
        let you into the building.)  If you think you can't make Thursday
        night, let us know; we are often known to reschedule to other times
        (just look at the calendar history).
        We are not too advanced: we are working on Kent and a quarter
        of Plain Bob Minor, but we would love to have your presence,
        beginner or advanced.</p>
