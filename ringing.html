    <p>We are the Bay Area Guild of Change Ringers, founded in 2013.  There are
        no towers in the area, but we ring handbells.  We ring on a set of eight bells
        graciously loaned to us by Laura Dickerson.  The regulars are
        Edward, Risha and Jenna.  Former regulars include Leland.
        </p>

        <p>
        We're currently on hiatus because one of our regulars has
        a hand injury, so we don't have enough ringers.
        If you are planning a
        visit, please do let us know <a
        href="mailto:change-ringers@lists.stanford.edu">by email</a>
        so we can setup a practice.
        We are not too advanced: we are working on Kent and a quarter of
        Plain Bob Minor, but we would love to have your presence, beginner
        or advanced.</p>
