<h1>Notes about the Stanford CS departmnet</h1>
<div id="content">
    <div class="cb"><p>When I became a PhD student, I noticed that there was a lot
        of important, ambient information that wasn't immediately obvious when I was an
        applicant.  I’m hoping that this page will be useful, candid
        views on some of the inner workings of a computer science
        department that are otherwise rather opaque to an outsider.
        The opinions on this page are <em>strictly mine</em>, and some of it may
        be misinformed or just plain wrong, so take with a dash of salt.
        Last update was on <strong>April 17, 2013</strong>.</p>

<h2>Professors</h2>
<div class="cb">
    <p>These are Stanford's recently hired professors:</p>
    <ul><li>2012: <a href="http://cs.stanford.edu/~pliang/">Percy Liang</a>, machine learning and natural language processing, hails from MIT.  He's building up a lively group which will include at least Hertz fellow <a href="http://cs.stanford.edu/~jsteinhardt/">Jacob Steinhardt</a>.</li>
        <li>2012: <a href="http://hci.stanford.edu/msb/">Michael Bernstein</a>, crowd-sourced computing, hails from MIT.  Stanford is losing a substantial chunk of its HCI faculty in the near future (including <a href="http://hci.stanford.edu/jheer/">Jeffrey Heer</a>, <a href="http://hci.stanford.edu/srk/apply/">Scott Klemmer</a>), so if you are interested in HCI you are likely to interact with Bernstein.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Assistant professors: <a href="http://vladlen.info/">Vladlen Koltun</a> (2005), <a href="http://bejerano.stanford.edu/pi.html">Gill Bejerano</a> (2007), <a href="http://hci.stanford.edu/jheer/students/">Jeffrey Heer</a> (2009, leaving), <a href="http://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/">Jure Leskovec</a> (2009), <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~skatti/">Sachin Katti</a> (2010), <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~rrwill/">Ryan Williams</a> (2011)</p>
    <p>Working with a pre-tenure professor can be challenging (in both a
    good and bad way); do your research.</p>

<h2>Interviewing</h2>
<div class="cb">
    <p>The following candidates gave job talks at Stanford for the 2013 hiring cycle:</p>
    <ul><li><a href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~blucia0a/">Brandon Lucia</a> (University of Washington). Architecture, job talk title is “Using Architecture Support to make Concurrent and Parallel Software Less Buggy and More Reliable”</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.floraine.org/">Floraine Berthouzoz</a> (Berkeley). HCI and graphics, job talk title is “Teaching People and Machines How to Enhance Images”</li>
        <li><a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/jrk/">Jonathan Ragan-Kelley</a> (MIT). He's behind <a href="http://halide-lang.org/">Halide</a>.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~matei/">Matei Zaharia</a> (Berkeley).  He's behind <a href="http://spark-project.org/">Spark</a>, a neat failure-robust in-memory clustering solution that can interactively give answers to queries on multi-gigabyte datsets.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~virgi/">Virginia Vassilevska William</a> (Stanford/Berkeley). She earned some notoriety for being the world record holder for fastest matrix multiplication algorithm, but her overall mathematics has an interesting streak of empiricism.</li>
        <li><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/anshulkundaje/">Anshul Kundaje</a> (MIT). Bioinformatics.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.chrisharrison.net/">Chris Harrison</a> (CMU). HCI and sensing.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Hiring is a complex process that is often dependent on the transient needs of
    the university more than whether or not a given candidate will succeed
    or not (at the top level, basically anyone will probably do OK.)  My impression
    is that Stanford is bullish on HCI and PL, and bearish on systems.</p>
