    <p>I own a <strong>ThinkPad X61 Tablet</strong>.  I am currently looking for
    a replacement laptop model with a comparably good tablet.</p>
</div>
<h2>X61 Tablet</h2>
<div class="cb">
    <p>I have most recently reinstalled this machine with Ubuntu Saucy.  At the moment,
    there is a regression in Unity which results in greatly impaired graphics performance;
    if you use a proper window manager like XMonad there is no problem.
    Suspend and hibernate still work out of the box.  I also can
    hibernate with an encrypted swap partition on main disk.</p>
    <p>I have a home-cooked setup of scripts (partially stolen from <a href="http://luke.no-ip.org/x60tablet/">Luke</a>) for screen
    rotation with the accelerometer.  The modified <code>hdaps</code> kernel
    module that you need can be setup with <code>m-a a-i tp-smapi</code>.  The last
    time I checked, the calibration interface did not work, so I have hard-coded
    an appropriate calibration parameter.</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Category:X61_Tablet">ThinkWiki</a> had
    a very excellent set of pages about ThinkPads, though I have not referred to them
    in a while.</p>
